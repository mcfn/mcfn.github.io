Bootcamp in new company is over.
Now working in new team, focus on APP and SDK development.

I think I’ve been a little more lazy these days. Especially the last day in the bootcamp times.
But now, it seems that I’ll have more time to being arranged in the coming months..

Maybe, I should get some fun in learning and working on new APPS.

Anyway, these days, I’m thinking about the time in the college.
I almost spend all of my last 4 years in internship.
Meet many nice people, some cool and awful codings.
And the time when I and our team working on ICPC.

It seems that I almost have no time to write somethings, or summarise somethings.
Maybe it just because I’m too lazy.

I think I can start from now, the ending of the bootcamp, refreshing and moving on.
